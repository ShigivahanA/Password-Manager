In this project, I had built a **Password Manager**

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

In this Password Manager app, users start with empty input fields for the website, username, and password, and if no passwords have been added yet, a “No Passwords” view is displayed. When a user enters values in all three fields and clicks the Add button, a new password item is added to the list, the password count increments by one, and the password is shown as stars by default. The input fields are then reset to empty values, but if the Show Passwords checkbox is selected, the actual password is displayed instead of stars. The app also allows users to search for saved passwords by website name, displaying only the matching items regardless of case, and showing the “No Passwords” view if no matches are found. Each password item has a delete button, and clicking it removes the respective password and updates the password count. When all passwords are deleted, the “No Passwords” view is displayed again, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience.
